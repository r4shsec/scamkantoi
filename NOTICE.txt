      SCAMKANTOI : PROJECT PERMANENTLY CLOSED
=========================================================

STATUS: INACTIVE
DATE:   JANUARY 3, 2026 - JANUARY 10, 2026
EMAIL: r4shsec@protonmail.com

=========================================================

Hey everyone,
I'm an independent cybersecurity researcher. I've always believed in pursuing truth and keeping neutrality.This blog wasn't made with the intent to harm, but with intent to warn others (moral duty).
I've opened this blog post to warn others of potential scams and cover-ups including fees, suspicious activities and etc which aren't publicly available by said organization. We also collect publicly available data that's available via Open-Sourced Intelligence (OSINT) research or metadata via files.
We've also worked hard with said organizations to settle disputes including being transparent.
Despite my efforts, I was strictly told by third-parties to comply. After a while, the decision was made not to pursue further to prevent lawsuits and emotional strain that may affect me in the future.
I wish to pursue a future out of harms way and stay happy, friendly and neutral with anyone I meet ;)

=========================================================

Organizations chaired by powerful entities would often use tactics of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) to silence critics, journalists, and activists. They're also to identify anonymous or pseudonymous critics.
